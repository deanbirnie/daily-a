## What is Daily A?

Daily A is a web application created by Dean Birnie as a portfolio project for the ALX Software Engineering program. The application itself is a motivation and goal tracking tool that helps users break their lofty ambitions into small, daily goals that they can track and score so they know exactly where they are in their journey and when they're struggling to keep up it shows exactly what areas are lacking.

## The Stack

For this project I have opted for the tried and tested MERN stack. These technologies are relatively new to me and so using them for this project gives me a great opportunity to learn them and add them to my arsenal. MongoDB is a fantastic data storage option and offers a degree of flexibility that isn't found in traditional relational database software. It interfaces extremely well with the rest of the stack.

JavaScript in general is such a wonderful technology to use in the creation of web applications and libraries like ExpressJS, NodeJS and ReactJS (the other components in the stack) just extend its functionality evven further.
