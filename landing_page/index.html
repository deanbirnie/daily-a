                    Daily A helps you to organise and keep track of your goals. We give you space to
                     create and manage goals and a daily card that allows you to prioritise and score 
                     goals for a given day.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I came up with the idea after trying to find something that would help motivate me enough
                    to stick to my goals. I had no problem setting goals but soon after they'd fall by the wayside.
                    I wanted to make something that would force me to engage with them at the start of every day
                    and then rate my performance over time. It's more the constant engagement that helps you than
                    actually keeping track of your goals. If you're interested in following the development you can
